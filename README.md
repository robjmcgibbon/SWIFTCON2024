# SWIFTCON 2024- DMO Simulation Example

This is a notebook which takes you through the complete process of running and analysing a DMO simulation (initial conditions, simulation, halo finding, halo catalogues).

The notebook should be run with a [bash kernel](https://pypi.org/project/bash_kernel/).

If you are using cosma, the script `cosma_env.sh` will create a virtual python environment and install all required dependencies. For those not on cosma the python dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`, and the dependencies for the other codes are listed in the notebook itself.

Question welcome to mcgibbon@strw.leidenuniv.nl
